                                    <h2>Blockchain Internet of Things (BIoT)</h2>
                                    <p>As the transition to a data driven world accelerates impelled by the pace of
                                        technological innovation in Internet enabled devices many of societal norms will
                                        be
                                        challenged.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The increasing competition for scarce resources will drive companies to
                                        strive to find the cutting edge to maintain their lead ahead of any rival. <br>
                                        It is in
                                        this ecosystem that blockchain technology can offer IoT platforms a model for
                                        distributing trusted information in a non centralized and more secure way. There
                                        is
                                        still much research needed to be done to improve both the scalabily of
                                        blockchain
                                        solutions and the application to the developing IoT ecosystem.</p>


                                    <p>The current state of security for IoT devices varies greatly between
                                        manufacturers
                                        and is one of the main stumbling blocks preventing increased adoption of this
                                        technology.</p>


                                    <p>As more devices are connected to the Internet and considering that many IoT
                                        devices
                                        have limited power available, being run on batteries, the issue of addressing
                                        such
                                        devices on the Internet becomes a major problem. IPv6 has a 128-bit address
                                        space
                                        whereas blockchain has a 160-bit address space and can provide 4.3 billion more
                                        addresses than can IPv6 thus making blockchain a more scalable solution for
                                        IoT.</br>
                                        Many IoT devices due to power constraints and lack of computing capacity would
                                        be
                                        unable to support an IPv6 stack.</p>
                                    <p>The use of blockchain technology to administer the
                                        addressing of IoT devices eliminates the need for a central authority such as
                                        the
                                        Internet Assigned Numbers Authority to supervise and maintain this vital
                                        service.
                                        As the owner of an IoT device changes during its lifetime from the manufacturer
                                        through the supply chain to the consumer. There needs to be a system in place to
                                        manage this and other identity relationships until the device is decommissioned.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Another challenge is the managing of the attributes that a device might have, for
                                        example, the make, serial number, location, and GPS coordinates to name a few.
                                        IoT
                                        devices will also have relationships that can be device to device, device to
                                        human
                                        or device to a service. These changes in relationships can also include such as
                                        sold
                                        by, shipped by and repaired by, all need to be recorded and updated during the
                                        life
                                        cycle of the device.</p>
