                                            crowd and cheering the home team on to victory, more than ever before
                                            stadium
                                            operators are challenged to lure fans away from their couch and big screen
                                            TV's.
                                            In
                                            the age of digital media and mobile consumption fans expect a new kind of
                                            stadium
                                            experience; enhanced by their mobile device allowing them to keep track of
                                            what's
                                            going on, access information about their team, and share their experience at
                                            the
                                            stadium across social media.</p>

                                        <p>To correspond with the new ways in which fans consume sports, over the last
                                            20
                                            years
                                            teams have directed more of their marketing budget towards engaging fans in
                                            their
                                            homes. The truth is however that having fans in stadium, spending money on
                                            concessions and merchandise, dwarfs any potential revenue source of a fan
                                            watching
                                            at home. Therein lies the struggle. How do teams get their fans off the
                                            couch
                                            and
                                            into the stadium?</p>

                                        <p>Stadium operators have a massive opportunity at hand. By transforming the
                                            stadium

                                            management capabilities.</p>

                                        <p>The state of the art stadium is a miracle of technological integration. The
                                            foundational physical infrastructure includes miles of cabling offering an
                                            abundance
                                            of power and networking capabilities along with thousands of access points

                                        <p>With all these variables at play ensuring app coverage can be a major
                                            challenge
                                            as
                                            the networks will have to cope with massive crowds in dense areas and manage

                                            streams of traffic.</p>

                                        <p>Needless to say, this level requires a significant investment by the team and
                                            the
                                            stadium owner.</p>

                                        <p>Existing LTE and 4G networks will struggle to meet demand as the Internet of
                                            Things

                                            (IoT) brings more devices into the fold. The future smart stadium will of

                                            that, essentially, Google+ wasn’t worth the expense to support and secure.

                                        <p>The fundamental ingredient powering the facility of modern technology is
                                            data. The
                                            availability of data combined with relevant attributes has become a refined
                                            asset
                                            class in and of itself. In much the same way that other asset classes fuel
                                            economic
                                            motive and consumer interaction, data, specifically in its precision has
                                            become a
                                            security against the slings and arrows of the world economy.</p>

                                        <p>All organizations within this mode of organization fall victim to a common
                                            interference: spontaneous organization and cross cooperation based on big
                                            data
                                            analysis with minimal oversight of the system or process. Suffice it to say
                                            this
                                            approach to the creation and dissemination of information is lacking.</p>

                                        <h4>Understanding The Problem</h4>

                                        <p>The way we understand and shape the world is in constant flux, and technology
                                            is the
                                            primary agent of this change. To meet the on demand expectations of the user
                                            and
                                            future proof an application to not only compel today's generation of users
                                            but the
                                            next and next thereafter, there is a need for buy in among shareholders to
                                            confront
                                            the limitations of the existing technological paradigm.</p>

                                        <p>Most applications we use are centralized. This is to say that the entirety of
                                            the
                                            computer code is contained on a centralized server. When we use a web or
                                            mobile
                                            application, assuming we are requesting data that is not already on the
                                            application,
                                            the requests are mediated through a service provider, which then
                                            communicates with a
                                            central server and relays the appropriate command response back to the user
                                            in the
                                            form of an activity represented on the application. If the central server
                                            fails the
                                            whole application crumbles to a fault. At a much broader level an
                                            archipelago of
                                            centralized databases , and often become classified as assets.</p>

                                        <p>Permissioned computational structures can remedy this situation to an extent,
                                            but
                                            fundamentally there must be an agreement at the source of these permissions;
                                            assurity that nothing in the coded permissions will allow one organization
                                            increased
                                            access to information or worse, control over the system entirely.</p>

                                        <p>The limitations of cloud computing impose an upper limit on further
                                            innovation.</p>
                                        <ul>

                                            <li>-depends on a servers ability to compute</li>

                                            <li>-requires third party intermediaries to monitor and assess the activity
                                                and

                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Decentralization is overwhelmingly recognized by data scientists,
                                            technologists, and
                                            futurists alike, as the solution and next frontier of the digital economy.

                                        <p>Presenting a conceptual understanding of the blockchain for the sports
                                            industry
                                            within the broader process of the emerging next generation internet.</p>

                                        <p>Blockchain is an emerging technology that is currently experiencing very
                                            rapid
                                            evolution. Within the space of 2 to 3 years it has gone through changes in
                                            its
                                            technical implementation and our understanding of what it is and can be.</p>

                                        <p>Blockchain calls into question what might have seemed to be established
                                            parameters
                                            of the modern world like currency, economics, trust, value and exchange. To
                                            make
                                            sense of this one needs to understand it in a holistic context all the way
                                            from its
                                            technicalities to its aspirational potential.</p>

                                        <p>On its most basic level the blockchain is a new class of information
                                            technology that
                                            combines cryptography with distributed computing. It is a network of
                                            computers which
                                            collaborate towards maintaining a shared and secure database. This database
                                            consists
                                            of a string of blocks—each one a record of data that has been encrypted and
                                            given a
                                            unique identifier called a hash. Nodes on the network validate transactions,
                                            add
                                            them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block
                                            to other
                                            nodes so that all have a copy of the database. In order to verify that the
                                            information being broadcasted is correct the blockchain relies upon a
                                            distributed
                                            consensus algorithm. In order to make an entry onto the blockchain database,
                                            all the
                                            active computers must verify that the information is correct, therefore no
                                            one
                                            computer can make an alteration without the approval of others. Once
                                            complete the
                                            block goes into the blockchain as a permanent record. Each time a block is
                                            completed
                                            another block is generated. These blocks are set about in a chronological
                                            and linear
                                            order, connected like links in a chain. All transactions in the block are
                                            immutable,
                                            which means that they cannot be deleted. Thus a perfect history of all
                                            activities
                                            and transactions on the blockchain is available as a record.</p>

                                        <p>This much is clear: Blockchain will redesign the internet and shake up the
                                            existing
                                            centralized incumbents. This paper will introduce the reader to the culture
                                            and its
                                            aspirations. It is accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of web
                                            technologies and economics.</p>

                                            and computer code. This strengthens our capacity for collaboration and
                                            cooperation
                                            between organizations and individuals within peer networks. For the first
                                            time in
                                            human history people anywhere can trust each other and transact within large

                                            littered with theoretical challenges which called upon developers to build
                                            from a
                                            toolkit ill suited to the task. Native programming languages have
                                            undoubtedly become
                                            useful in this respect, however, this is invariably a bandage solution to a
                                            surgical

                                            hardware, and increases in graphic display are no small feat to be sure but
                                            in the

                                            concentrated along the broader landscape of possibilities this progress is
                                            microscopic.</p>

                                        <p>This problem is solved with the use of a decentralized network.The secret to
                                            this
                                            network is its use of public-private key cryptography and consensus
                                            protocols for
                                            ensuring the authenticity of published data. This ensures that no-one can
                                            modify the
                                            application or any of the contents their within. Instead of getting
                                            electricity from
                                            a massive power generating station, we can think of the distributed network
                                            as a
                                            wide distribution of smaller power generating stations which have the
                                            potential to
                                            power new methods of digital distribution.</p>

                                        <p>In a stadium environment this power supply is the fans mobile devices. The

                                            using the applications on their devices the more power. We intend to convert
                                            this
                                            power into participation through a reformatted and redesigned approach to

                                            software makes up the technology level of the concept of the stadium as a

                                                <p>Although this strong technological foundation is of vital importance
                                                    for providing

                                                    transformational potential for value creation lies in opening up the
                                                    stadium for
                                                    fans and other partners to build on top of the

                                                    existing infrastructure. This would include the development and
                                                    release of
                                                    protocols, an application program interface(API), and a software

                                                    the core technology of the stadium.</p>

                                                <p>A wayfinding application could be an especially valuable resource.
                                                    Such an
                                                    application could guide fans to the least congested stadium entrance
                                                    and provide

                                                    easily transmitted across social media, in-game promotions and

                                                <p>Social listening would give teams and the venue immediate feedback
                                                    from the fans
                                                    regarding their experience at the stadium and help to resolve any

                                                    problems. The last thing that a team and stadium owner wants are
                                                    disgruntled fans
                                                    tweeting the stadium's shortcomings to their friends, thus keeping
                                                    potential clients
                                                    away.</p>

                                                <p>By opening up the stadium's digital presence to developers, sponsors
                                                    and users to
                                                    build upon the resulting third-party experiences compliment what the
                                                    team can
                                                    deliver. The team is focused on delivering the best possible game
                                                    experience to the
                                                    fans. By giving developers access to the stadium infrastructure
                                                    allows the team to
                                                    benefit from the combined creativity of many people. These
                                                    experiences can include
                                                    augmented reality and virtual reality by both recreating the stadium
                                                    and the games
                                                    as well as overlaying the player and game data over the field whilst
                                                    the game is in
                                                    action. Another example of a third party application would be the
                                                    creation of a
                                                    system where the fans could bet on in-game events using virtual
                                                    currency or
                                                    bitcoin/cryptocurrency or even fiat dollars.</p>

                                                <p>Stadiums could also allow fans access to some stadium elements such
                                                    as cameras to
                                                    personalize their view of the on-field action.</p>

                                                <p>As a stadium competes not only with other stadiums and events for a
                                                    fans patronage,
                                                    it is also competing with the allure of watching the game in the
                                                    comfort of your own
                                                    home.</p>

                                                <p>In building a platform with all the latest advances in consumer
                                                    technology that a
                                                    stadium has the ability to woo the fan out of their comfort zone. As
                                                    these new
                                                    technologies can be used outside of the stadium the operators need
                                                    to be conscious
                                                    of the changes needed to build the platform and the operational and
                                                    organisational
                                                    mindset changes that this entails.</p>

                                                <p>The transformation of a stadium into a platform also consists of
                                                    opening up the
                                                    stadium

                                                    technology to third parties, including sponsors, developers and
                                                    advertisers. This
                                                    change requires a major change in the stadium business model. The
                                                    economics of a
                                                    platform is significantly different from that of selling the stadium
                                                    experience of
                                                    the past. That is an event surrounded by neighbouring businesses
                                                    such as retail and
                                                    food concessions for the price of a ticket. The new stadium model
                                                    forces the stadium
                                                    owner to be more than just the operator of the venue. They must
                                                    become the architect
                                                    and manager of the platform. This paradigm shift

                                                    does carry risk, however, there is also a powerful potential
                                                    opportunity to create
                                                    new sources of value for fans and partners. There are three main
                                                    elements required
                                                    to maintain and build the stadium platform.</p>

                                                <p>The evolution of the stadium as a platform and a stand-alone product
                                                    can be
                                                    attributed to what is known as network effects. Simply put, as more
                                                    people use the
                                                    platform the utility of the platform to other users increases. A

                                                    isolated network is useless, it only becomes useful when it connects
                                                    to other
                                                    telephones and the more telephones connected the usefulness.</p>

                                                <p>As the number of users on a platform increases it becomes
                                                    increasingly more
                                                    attractive for developers to create applications that run on the

                                                    <p>Ticket fraud occurs on a large scale because tickets are easily
                                                        duplicated and can
                                                        be sold multiple times. Bad actors can easily duplicate
                                                        mechanisms
                                                        for proving a

                                                    <p>Smart tickets are intangible. Duplicating a ticket is not
                                                        possible
                                                        because there’s
                                                        simply nothing to duplicate. The smartphone becomes the ticket.

                                                        The consumer volunteers their attention, providing information
                                                        to
                                                        the seller, in
                                                        exchange for some kind of reward. The true value comes from the
                                                        marketers ability to
                                                        ascribe value to a members attention, advocacy or data, allowing
                                                        them to better
                                                        decide what kind of investment they should make towards them.

                                                        <p>Blockchain Marketing requires that we abandon many of the

                                                        </p>

                                                        <p>We begin with a supposition:</p>

                                                            make

                                                        <p>From a commercial perspective, this type of engagement

                                                            has
                                                            already

                                                        <p>The end result is a transparent, ethical marketing program
